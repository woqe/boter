=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation is primarily aimed at provider authors. See L<provider(7)>
for further information.

The key exchange (OSSL_OP_KEYEXCH) operation enables providers to implement key
exchange algorithms and make them available to applications via the API
functions L<EVP_PKEY_derive_init_ex(3)>, and L<EVP_PKEY_derive(3)> (as well as
other related functions).

All "functions" mentioned here are passed as function pointers between
F<libcrypto> and the provider in B<OSSL_DISPATCH> arrays via
B<OSSL_ALGORITHM> arrays that are returned by the provider's
provider_query_operation() function
(see L<provider-base(7)/Provider Functions>).

All these "functions" have a corresponding function type definition
named B<OSSL_{name}_fn>, and a helper function to retrieve the
function pointer from an B<OSSL_DISPATCH> element named
B<OSSL_get_{name}>.
For example, the "function" OP_keyexch_newctx() has these:

 typedef void *(OSSL_OP_keyexch_newctx_fn)(void *provctx);
 static ossl_inline OSSL_OP_keyexch_newctx_fn
     OSSL_get_OP_keyexch_newctx(const OSSL_DISPATCH *opf);

B<OSSL_DISPATCH> arrays are indexed by numbers that are provided as
macros in L<openssl-core_numbers.h(7)>, as follows:

 OP_keyexch_newctx                OSSL_FUNC_KEYEXCH_NEWCTX
 OP_keyexch_freectx               OSSL_FUNC_KEYEXCH_FREECTX
 OP_keyexch_dupctx                OSSL_FUNC_KEYEXCH_DUPCTX

 OP_keyexch_init                  OSSL_FUNC_KEYEXCH_INIT
 OP_keyexch_set_peer              OSSL_FUNC_KEYEXCH_SET_PEER
 OP_keyexch_derive                OSSL_FUNC_KEYEXCH_DERIVE

 OP_keyexch_set_ctx_params        OSSL_FUNC_KEYEXCH_SET_CTX_PARAMS
 OP_keyexch_settable_ctx_params   OSSL_FUNC_KEYEXCH_SETTABLE_CTX_PARAMS

A key exchange algorithm implementation may not implement all of these functions.
In order to be a consistent set of functions a provider must implement
OP_keyexch_newctx, OP_keyexch_freectx, OP_keyexch_init and OP_keyexch_derive.
All other functions are optional.

A key exchange algorithm must also implement some mechanism for generating,
loading or importing keys via the key management (OSSL_OP_KEYMGMT) operation.
See L<provider-keymgmt(7)> for further details.

=head2 Context Management Functions

OP_keyexch_newctx() should create and return a pointer to a provider side
structure for holding context information during a key exchange operation.
A pointer to this context will be passed back in a number of the other key
exchange operation function calls.
The paramater I<provctx> is the provider context generated during provider
initialisation (see L<provider(3)>).

OP_keyexch_freectx() is passed a pointer to the provider side key exchange
context in the I<ctx> parameter.
This function should free any resources associated with that context.

OP_keyexch_dupctx() should duplicate the provider side key exchange context in
the I<ctx> parameter and return the duplicate copy.

=head2 Shared Secret Derivation Functions

OP_keyexch_init() initialises a key exchange operation given a provider side key
exchange context in the I<ctx> paramter, and a pointer to a provider key object
in the I<provkey> parameter. The key object should have been previously
generated, loaded or imported into the provider using the key management
(OSSL_OP_KEYMGMT) operation (see provider-keymgmt(7)>.

OP_keyexch_set_peer() is called to supply the peer's public key (in the
I<provkey> parameter) to be used when deriving the shared secret.
It is also passed a previously initialised key exchange context in the I<ctx>
parameter.
The key object should have been previously generated, loaded or imported into
the provider using the key management (OSSL_OP_KEYMGMT) operation (see
provider-keymgmt(7)>.

OP_keyexch_derive() performs the actual key exchange itself by deriving a shared
secret.
A previously initialised key exchange context is passed in the I<ctx>
parameter.
The derived secret should be written to the location I<secret> which should not
exceed I<outlen> bytes.
The length of the shared secret should be written to I<*secretlen>.
If I<secret> is NULL then the maximum length of the shared secret should be
written to I<*secretlen>.

=head2 Key Exchange Parameters

See L<OSSL_PARAM(3)> for further details on the parameters structure used by
the OP_keyexch_set_params() function.

OP_keyexch_set_ctx_params() sets key exchange parameters associated with the
given provider side key exchange context I<ctx> to I<params>.
Any parameter settings are additional to any that were previously set.

Parameters currently recognised by built-in key exchange algorithms are as
follows.
Not all parameters are relevant to, or are understood by all key exchange
algorithms:

=over 4

=item "pad" (B<OSSL_EXCHANGE_PARAM_PAD>) <unsigned integer>

Sets the padding mode for the associated key exchange ctx.
Setting a value of 1 will turn padding on.
Setting a vlue of 0 will turn padding off.
If padding is off then the derived shared secret may be smaller than the largest
possible secret size.
If padding is on then the derived shared secret will have its first bytes filled
with 0s where necessary to make the shared secret the same size as the largest
possible secret size.

=back

OP_keyexch_settable_ctx_params() gets a constant B<OSSL_PARAM> array that
decribes the settable parameters, i.e. parameters that can be used with
OP_signature_set_ctx_params().
See L<OSSL_PARAM(3)> for the use of B<OSSL_PARAM> as parameter descriptor.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OP_keyexch_newctx() and OP_keyexch_dupctx() should return the newly created
provider side key exchange context, or NULL on failure.

OP_keyexch_init(), OP_keyexch_set_peer(), OP_keyexch_derive() and
OP_keyexch_set_params() should return 1 for success or 0 on error.
